1. Wiki

There are some pointers for setting up your Tracks copy for testing at http://www.getontracks.org/wiki/Testing/

2. SQLITE3 FOR TESTING

By default, tests are configured to run using sqlite3 in memory mode to increase speed. You will need the sqlite3-ruby gem for this.

To avoid showing the migrations as tests are run, add the following to your database.yml below 'database: ":memory:"':

  verbosity: quiet

If you want to run tests using another database, that's fine, too. Just change your database.yml accordingly.

3. SELENIUM TESTS (Selenium on Rails)

This testing style is deprecated and are being moved over to Selenium via RSpec stories by lukemelia (See #4 below for the new style).
 
To run selenium tests, start Tracks in test mode using

  script/server -e test
 
Then open a browser to

  http://localhost:3000/selenium/
  
and interact with the test runner.

For more information about Selenium on Rails, see vendor/plugins/selenium-on-rails/README

4. RSPEC STORY RUNNER TESTS

To run the stories, which are browser tests using selenium, start Tracks in test mode using

  rake db:test:prepare
  script/server -e test
 
Then start Selenium by running

  selenium
 
which is a script installed with the Selenium gem (sudo gem install Selenium)

Once the site and selenium server are running, then run all stories with

  script/story

or a specific set with

  script/story stories/login/*.story
