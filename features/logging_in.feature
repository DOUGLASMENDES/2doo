Feature: Existing user logging in
  In order to keep my things private
  As an existing user
  I want to log in with my username and password

  Background:
    Given the following user records
      | login    | password | is_admin | first_name | last_name |
      | testuser | secret   | false    | Test       | User      |
      | admin    | secret   | true     | Admin      | User      |

  Scenario Outline: Succesfull and unsuccesfull login
    When I go to the login page
    And I submit the login form as user "<user>" with password "<password>"
    Then I should be <there>
    And I should see "<message>"

    Examples:
      | user  | password | there                       | message            |
      | admin | secret   | redirected to the home page | Login successful   |
      | admin | wrong    | on the login page           | Login unsuccessful |

  Scenario Outline: Unauthorized users cannot access Tracks and need to log in first
    Given there exists a project called "top secret" for user "testuser"
    And there exists a context called "@secret location" for user "testuser"
    When I go to the <page>
    Then I should be redirected to the login page
    When I submit the login form as user "testuser" with password "secret"
    Then I should be redirected to the <next page>
    And I should see "<logout>"

    Examples:
      | page                                                    | next page                                               | logout             |
      | home page                                               | home page                                               | Logout (Test User) |
